# Weather Dashboard Project

Welcome to the Weather Dashboard Project, a 10-session project-based course in Python. This repository contains the necessary materials to complete the project, including worksheets, cheat sheets, source code, and slides.

## Project Overview

In this project, you will create a weather dashboard that fetches data from OpenWeatherMap API, manages data with CSV, visualizes data with Matplotlib, and builds a dashboard with Jupyter Widgets. You will also learn how to scrape data from websites and use APIs (optional).

## Repository Structure

* `slides`: Slides for each session, including notes and examples.
* `worksheets`: Worksheets for each session, including exercises and quizzes.
* `cheatsheets`: Cheat sheets for each session, summarizing key concepts and syntax.
* `code`: Source code for each session, including examples and exercises.
* `data`: Sample data used in the project.
* `docs`: This README file and other documentation.

## Getting Started
